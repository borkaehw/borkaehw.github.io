    "I consider myself as a highly capable software engineer. Complementing my diverse skill set, I have developed an excellent understanding of a wide range of programming languages, along with signal processing and machine learning models, and have demonstrated this capability throughout my ongoing Electrical and Computer Engineering degree from University of Michigan, which is due to be completed in Spring 2018.",
    "While pursuing my education, I have been recognized for my outstanding ability to work as part of a team. It is for this reason I have participated in multiple team-oriented courses and projects and have consistently delivered finished assignments as per requirements and always within the allotted time provided. I am a project guy instead of an exam guy, which means I prefer extensive brainstorming teamwork environment instead of writing true-false questions and remembering correct answers.",

In addition to the skills listed, I also have an excellent work ethic, personality and tenacious attitude. Most important of all, I am an easygoing person capable of casting constructive suggestions, which makes me an effective team player. I look forward to hearing from you in due course."
